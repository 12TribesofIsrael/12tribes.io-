                <p>The tribe of Judah (American Blacks) along with Benjamin and Levi were sold into captivity by
                the Africans and the Arabs to the white-man. The white man then transported them in chains on
                slave ships to America to serve hard bondage as slaves.</p>

                <p>Judah was the fourth born son of Jacob, his name means “Yahawah’s Praise”, Genesis 29:35.
                “And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said: Now will I praise the Lord: therefore
                she called his name Judah; and left bearing.” They came to America in cargo slave ships
                between the late 1500’s – early 1800’s.</p>

                <p>Psalms 78:2-4, “I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old: which we have
                heard and known, and our fathers have told us. We will not hide them from their children
                shewing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord…”</p>

                <p>“I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old”, is prophetic of Christ!” In
                Mathew 13:10, “And the disciples came and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in
                parables?” Christ explains that unto the masses of Israel the proper understanding of the
                scriptures was not given, but rather for them: the disciples, whose job it was to teach Israel.
                Guiding them back to the Heavenly Father through Christ. Matthew 10:5-7</p>

                <p>“We will not hide them from their children shewing to the generation to come the praises of the
                Lord.” It is the disciple’s job to teach the true understanding of the Bible in the name of Christ
                and not hide the mysteries of the Lord but instead make it clear to all.
                Genesis 49:1, “And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, gather yourselves together, that I may
                tell you that which shall befall you in THE LAST DAYS.” Read Heb. 1:2.</p>

                <p>Genesis 49:8. “Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck
                of thine enemies; thy fathers’ children shall bow down before thee.”</p>

                <p>“Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise”, all the tribes of Israel shall praise the tribe
                of Judah for bringing them the truth, and for the risks they took to help Israel under oppression.
                Thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies”, for many decades the American blacks have
                risked their lives fighting with America’s political system for justice, equality, housing,
                desegregation, jobs and education. They’ve marched for miles, held vigil’s, boycotted, fought
                against law enforcement resulting in thousands of them being burned, lynched, hosed, attacked
                by dogs, clubbed, whipped, raped sodomized, firebombed. More importantly Judah has fought
                to bring out the truth about the Israelites. By Judah’s hand being in the neck of his enemies
                (America) he has choked the American political system for all kinds of benefits. As the American
                blacks begin to wake up and return to the Lord (as Judah), they are choking the lies of
                Americas’ educational and religious institutions; by teaching the truth of the Bible, proving
                Christ, is black and only died for the nation of Israel, and that the so called Negro and Indian
                scattered throughout the Americas are Israelites.</p>

                <p>“The neck of thine enemies”, is also giving you the geographical location of the tribe of Judah –
                North America.</p>

                <p>Zechariah 2:6-7, “Ho, ho, come forth and flee from the land of the NORTH (North America)..
                ..Deliver thyself. O Zion that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon (America)…”</p>

                <p>Jeremiah 16:14-15</p>

                <p>Psalms 137:7-8, “Remember O Lord the children of EDOM… O daughter of Babylon…”
                These prophetic scriptures tell us the people of EDOM (so called white people) are the daughter
                of Babylon (in North America), and Judah, would dwell there in captivity.</p>

                <p>Genesis 49:8B, “….thy father’s children shall bow down before thee.” In the end, all the tribes of
                Israel shall praise and bow down before Judah, because they will acknowledge that Judah is the
                head tribe and have fought to teach the truth to Israel and this is mainly due to Christ..</p>

                <p>Zechariah 12:7, “The Lord also shall save the tents of Judah first that the glory of the house of
                David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah.”</p>

                <p>Although the American blacks, have fought for many causes and brought about much change to
                the benefit of all the other tribes of Israel (better schooling, better jobs, better housing and many
                other benefits), all the tribes of Israel mock and look down on the American black. The West
                Indian blacks, Haitians, (the House of David), Puerto Ricans, and the Mexicans (inhabitants of
                Jerusalem) belittle and insult the American blacks, calling them lazy, thieves, no good bums,
                stupid etc. Therefore, the Lord promised that he will save Judah first, by giving him the
                understanding of the scriptures to teach and gather the other tribes of Israel under Christ;
                thereby all Israel will acknowledge Judah as the head tribe.</p>

                <p>Genesis 49:9, “Judah is a lion’s whelp: from the prey my son, thou art gone up: he stooped
                down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?</p>

                <p>“Judah is a lions whelp”, meaning the tribe of Judah is like a young lion powerful and fearless:
                from the prey, my son, thou art gone up”, Just like a young lion cub is hunting his “prey” and
                then gives up the hunt and becomes distracted. The “prey” is the enemies; the white man and
                all the other nations. But Judah, has left going after the prey, leaving the truth of the Bible, and
                became distracted/tricked by the philosophies of his enemies; religion. Christianity – Muslim
                etc., crime, selling drugs, killing each other, integration – thereby he has ceased from the hunt
                of his enemies.</p>

                <p>“He stooped down”, meaning just as a lion stoops down with intentions to attack and devour his
                prey. Likewise in the 40’s, 50’s, and 60’s the American blacks stooped down – formed various
                organizations to consider devouring the so called white man, for the injustice and oppression
                they have suffered.</p>

                <p>“He couched as a lion” meaning just as a lion couches about to attack, to devour his prey, so did
                the American blacks. In the late 50’s and 60’s they formed militant groups; no longer passive
                marches of protests but now carrying weapons in direct defiance of local law officials, it was
                time for kill or be killed, eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth. It was time for revolution, and during
                this era it appeared as if the American blacks would devour their enemies.</p>

                <p>“And as an old lion”, Judah, this young powerful lion was distracted from his purpose by
                infiltration and drugs in the black community, as an old lion gets tired and gives up the hunt, so
                did the various black militant groups. Infiltration and drug addiction caused Judah to lay down
                arms, and become complacent in society. This was a diabolical plot by the Illuminati, the CIA
                and the FBI.</p>

                <p>“Who shall rouse him up”, only the Most High, can rouse the spirit of the American blacks to the
                truth, and take his position as the tribe of Judah of the nation of Israel. In Zechariah 12:7, the
                Most High promised to rouse Judah up by saving his tents first by the proper understanding of
                the Bible!!!</p>

                <p>Revelation 11:11, “And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them,
                and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.” Also read
                Ezekiel 37:1-10</p>

                <p>Three days and an half is symbolic for 350 years when the bulk of the slaves were brought into
                the hands of America in 1620 (Read Daniel 7:25). 350 years after 1620 brings us to around
                1970; it was about 1970 when the truth really began to be pushed and taught concerning who
                the American blacks were – the real Jews. “The Spirit of life from God entered into them/’
                meaning the proper understanding of the Bible began to be taught in the name of CHRIST</p>

                <p>John 6:63 “…the words that I speak unto you: they are spirit, and they are life. ” Therefore, the
                true knowledge would come thru faith in Jesus Christ, that is the Spirit of life from God</p>

                <p>Genesis 49:</p>
                <p>v10- The Sceptre Shall Not Depart from Judah, nor a Lawgiver from between his feet, until
                Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.
                “The sceptre shall not depart from Judah…”, means the rulership shall not depart from the tribe
                of Judah; the King of Kings will come from Judah.</p>

                <p>“Nor a Lawgiver from between his feet…”, means the High Priest shall come from the SEED of
                Judah. What is between a man’s feet; His penis. This proves Christ was born through sex and
                NOT “Immaculate Conception”.</p>

                <p>“Until Shiloh come”, Shiloh means peaceable which is Jesus Christ.</p>

                <p>Read Hebrews chapter 7, it explains how Jesus Christ is after the order of Melchesidec. King of
                peace as well as our High priest. “Until Shiloh come” properly translated says “when Shiloh
                comes”. Prior to the coming of Christ it was the tribe of Levi that held the sceptre (rulership) ever
                since the days of the Maccabees.</p>

                <p>During the ministry of Christ, the high priest was Caiaphas – a Levite, read John 18:13. The
                historian Flavius Josephus records how Levi governed Israel under Roman rule. However when
                Christ came the Sceptre was handed to the tribe of Judah.</p>

                <p>“…and unto him shall the gathering of the people be” Means unto Christ shall the gathering of
                Israel be.</p>

                <p>Zechariah 12:7, “The Lord shall save the tents of Judah first…”, therefore Judah would be the
                first teachers of the Lord leading Israel unto Christ.</p>

                <p>This also proves the Twelve Tribes of Israel cannot be gathered except through Jesus Christ.</p>

                <p>Isaiah 53:</p>
                <p>V10- Yet It Pleased The Lord To Bruise Him; he hath put him to grief; when thou shalt make his
                soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and pleasure of the
                Lord shall prosper in his hand.</p>

                <p>V11- He shall see the travail of his and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous
                servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</p>

                <p>Acts 10:</p>

                <p>v36– “The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ…”</p>

                <p>The leaders of the Jews said this concerning Christ:</p>

                <p>John 11:</p>
                <p>v48- If we let him thus alone, all men (Israelites) will believe on him: and the Romans shall come
                and take away both our place and nation.”</p>

                <p>This verse was prophetic of Genesis 49:10. When Christ came and died for the sins of Israel
                then was resurrected. In the year 70 A.D., the Romans laid siege against Israel. Taking away
                afterwards both the place of Judah, as the religious leaders and their nation, leading them into
                captivity.</p>

                <p>“And unto him shall the gathering of the people be“, the him is Jesus Christ, of the tribe of
                Judah.</p>

                <p>Hebrews 7:</p>

                <p>v14- For it is evident that our Lord (Christ) sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake
                nothing concerning priesthood</p>

                <p>Genesis 49:</p>
                <p>v11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the choice vine; he washed his
                garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:</p>

                <p>The “vine” is referring to the grape vine.</p>

                <p>Matthew 21:</p>
                <p>v2- Saying unto them, go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass
                tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.</p>

                <p>Zechariah 9:</p>
                <p>v9- Rejoice greatly O daughter of Zion: shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King
                cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt
                the foal of an ass.</p>

                <p>“he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes”, is referring to Christ
                destroying the Edomite nations.</p>

                <p>Isaiah 63:</p>
                <p>V1- Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? This that is glorious
                in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty
                to save.</p>

                <p>V2- Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the
                winefat?</p>

                <p>V3- I have trodden the winepress alone: and of the people there was none with me: for I will
                tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon
                my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.</p>

                <p>Genesis 49:</p>
                <p>v12- His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
                “His eyes shall be red with wine”, means that the Messiah (Christ) would drink so much wine
                that the iris of his eyes would appear red (meaning the whites of his eyes were red).</p>

                <p>Mathews 11:</p>
                <p>v19- “The son of man came eating (meat) and drinking (wine) and they say behold a man
                gluttonous, and a wine bibber.</p>

                <p>Daniel 10:</p>
                <p>V5- Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose
                loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:</p>

                <p>V6- His body also was like the beryl (wore a green garment) and his face as the appearance of
                lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire (red with wine), and his arms and his feet like in colour to
                polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.”</p>

                <p>Revelation 1:</p>
                <p>V13- And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man, clothed with a
                garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.</p>

                <p>V14- His head and his hairs were white like woof as white as snow and his eyes were as a
                flame of fire (red with wine)</p>

                <p>V15- And his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace: and his voice as the sound
                of many waters.</p>

                <p>“and his teeth white with milk.” This is another trait Christ and the tribe of Judah, would have;
                pearly white teeth. During the days of slavery and segregation, the so-called white man made
                mockery of the American Blacks dark skin against their bright white teeth, (example, the sambo
                and mammy pictures)</p>

                <p>Deuteronomy 33:</p>
                <p>v7- And This Is the Blessing Of Judah: and he said, Hear Lord the voice of Judah: and bring him
                unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.</p>

                <p>“Hear Lord the voice of Judah“, although the Lord has aided his people in their moments of
                need, this is truly prophesying the time to come when the American blacks, will repent of their
                disobedience and return unto the Lord, as the tribe of Judah of the nation of Israel and teach
                who the 12 tribes of Israel are and lead them to Christ.</p>

                <p>Let’s prove that:</p>

                <p>II Chronicles 6:</p>
                <p>v36- If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth not) and thou be angry with
                them, and deliver them over before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a
                land far off or near:</p>

                <p>v37- yet if they bethink themselves (remember they are the Israelite’s) in the land whither they
                are carried captive (America), and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying
                we have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly;</p>

                <p>v38- If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul (keep commandments) in the
                land of their captivity. whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land
                (Israel) which thou gavest unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen
                (Jerusalem), and toward the house which I have built for thy name:</p>

                <p>v39- Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their
                supplications, and maintain their cause (deliver them from evil and destroy their enemies) and
                forgive thy people which have sinned against thee.</p>

                <p>“And bring him unto his people“, meaning bring Judah, with the perfect knowledge of the Bible,
                in Christ, unto his people the tribes of Israel. Therefore Judah, will be the main force in Christ, to
                teach the children of Israel.</p>

                <p>“Let his hands be sufficient for him”, meaning Judah, would have to fight and work hard for
                everything he acquires. The American blacks, have literally built up America, aiding in many
                inventions claimed by the so-called white man.</p>

                <p>“Be thou an help to him against his enemies“, if it were not for the help of the Heavenly Father,
                Judah (the American blacks) would have been totally destroyed by now: from the turmoil of the
                middle passage, the hard bondage in America, the Civil War, the lynching and fire bombings by
                the KKK, the infamous Tuskegee Experiment (when Judah was infected with Syphilis) bad food,
                medicine, and mass drug trafficking throughout their communities etc.”</p>

                <p>All nations that suffered under the hands of the so called white reaped reparations. Even 11 of
                the tribes of Israel, have a type of homeland allocated to them, except for Judah.
                The American blacks have yet to receive the 40 acres and 2 mules America promised them.</p>

                <p>Jeremiah 22:</p>
                <p>v13- Woe unto him that buildeth his house (America) by unrighteousness and his chambers by
                wrong (slavery); that useth his neighbors service without wages, and giveth him not for his work.
                This is what the sin that an Israelite named Shallum, was guilty of and the Lord passed severe
                judgement on him, so how much more will America be judged.</p>

                <p>Jeremiah 11:</p>
                <p>v13- For according to the number of thy cities were thy Gods, O Judah; and according to the
                number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to
                burn incense unto Baal.</p>

                <p>This explains that wherever Judah (the American blacks) are, they have false churches set up
                on every other street worshiping that shameful white image of Jesus Christ (which is really
                Cesare Borgia) screaming hallelujah.</p>

                Negroes are God’s long lost people, who are symbolically described in the Bible as the lost
                sheep of the Lost tribes of Israel.”</p>
